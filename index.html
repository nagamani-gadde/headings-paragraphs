        <h1>Using Quotations and Citation Tags in HTML</h1>
        <p>Here is a famous quote by Albert Einstein:</p>
        <p><pre>    <q>Life is like a bicycle. To keep your balance,you must keep moving.</q></pre></p>
        <p>In the context of this discussion, one might say:</p>
        <p><q>To keep your balance,you must keep moving.</q></p>
        <p>This quote is widely attributed to <cite>Albert Einsstein.</cite></p>
        <p>In literary studies, it's essential to cite sources properly.For example, if you're referencing a famous work like <cite>Pride and Prejudice.</cite></p>
        <p>by Jane Austen, you should always include the author's name to give proper credit.</p> 
        <p>Another classic example can be seen in <cite>Romer and Jullet</cite></p>
        <p>by William Shakespeare, where love and tragedy intertwine to create a timeless story.</p>
